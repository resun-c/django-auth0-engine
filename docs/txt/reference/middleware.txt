class SessionAuthMiddleware
	Authenticates a django.http.HttpRequest using the
	AuthEngine.authenticate() function. It authenticates the request only if
	the request doesn't already have a user property or if a
	django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser instance is assigned to the user
	property.

	The returned value of AuthEngine.authenticate(), is assigned to
	request.user as a SimpleLazyObject.

class HeaderAuthMiddleware
	This middleware functions similarly to SessionAuthMiddleware, except that it
	employs the AuthEngine.authenticate_header() function to perform the
	authentication.
