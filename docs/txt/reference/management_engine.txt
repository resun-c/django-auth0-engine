class ManagementEngine(domain, auth_engine)
	This class facilitates administrative tasks on the Auth0 platform,
	specifically focusing on updating user information.

	ManagementEngine relies on the same pieces of information that AuthEngine
	relies on. If any of these required pieces of information is missing, an
	AuthEngineError is raised.

	Each AuthEngine object has these attributes:

	cached_property ManagementEngine._auth0
		An instance of the Auth0 class from the Auth0 SDK.

	cached_property ManagementEngine.token_endpoint
		An instance of auth0.authentication.GetToken.

	property ManagementEngine.access_token
		Return an access token for the Management API. It automatically
		refreshes the token if it's expired and raises an AuthEngineError if
		it's unable to do so.

	These are the methods available in a user object:

	ManagementEngine.__bool__()
		Determines if the instance is usable based on the availability of
		required information.

	ManagementEngine.fetch_management_token()
		Fetch a Management API token using the token endpoint. Returns True
		upon success; False otherwise.

	ManagementEngine.update_user(id, body)
		This method updates the attributes of the user.

		Args:
			id (str): sub (a.k.a id) of the user whose attributes to update.

			body (dict): a dict containing the attributes to update.

		Upon successful update, it returns an AuthEngineResponse object
		containing the updated attributes. Otherwise, an AuthEngineError object
		is returned.

	The ManagementEngine class only serves one purpose: updating user
	information. The update_user() method is typically called by the User class
	after changing a user's attributes.
