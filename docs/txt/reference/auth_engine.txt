The AuthEngine: Support for user authentication using Auth0 Auth API.

Most methods accept a HttpRequest instance as the first argument. This instance
is used to store authentication-related session data for subsequent requests.

The methods rely on a set of constants that are fetched from settings.py (see
apps.py).

verify_id_token(token)
	Validates a token and returns the payload. If the token is invalid, an
	exception is raised.

	token
		token to be validated.

parse_response(response, request)
parse_response(response_dict, request)
	Parses the response received from various Auth0 endpoints or
	authentication session data and returns an instance of AuthEngineResponse
	or its subclass.

	If an id_token is present in the response, it is validated using
	verify_id_token(). If the token is valid, a User instance constructed from
	the payload is returned. In case, the token is expired and a refresh_token
	is present the tokens are refreshed and a User instance is returned. If the
	token is invalid an AuthEngineError instance with proper information is
	returned.

	The presence of an _id key in the response indicates sign-up. In this case,
	an AuthEngineResponse instance constructed from the response is returned.

	response
		typically response from Auth0 endpoints or auth session data from
		request.

to_session(user)
	Returns a dictionary containing authentication session data constructed
	from User instance.

	response
		User instance to acquire data from.
	
set_session(request, response)
	Sets authentication session data in the HttpRequest instance. The data
	is received from to_session(). The modification in the HttpRequest
	instance's session applies only if the new session data differs from the
	current session data.

	request
		The HttpRequest instance to set the session cookie to.

	response
		AuthEngineResponse to acquire the data from.

signin(request, username, password [, scope = cfg.Provider.Scopes.DEFAULT,
	realm = cfg.Provider.USERNAME_PASSWORD_REALM, audience = None,
	keep_signed_in = False])
	Signs in a user with username, and password.

	Upon authentication, it sets the auth session in the request and
	returns a User instance. Otherwise, an AuthEngineError instance with
	error information is returned; the request session is unchanged.

	request
		Django HttpRequest.

	username
		Resource owner's identifier.

	password
		resource owner's Secret.

	scope
		The string value of the different scopes the application is asking for.
		Multiple scopes are separated with whitespace. The default value is
		cfg.Provider.Scopes.DEFAULT.

	realm
		The string value of the realm the user belongs to. Set this if you want to add
		realm support at this grant. By default, it uses the
		"Username-Password-Authentication" connection.

	audience
		The unique identifier of the target API you want to access. For
		authentication purpose, it's the Auth0 application's client_id.

	keep_signed_in
		Whether or not to fetch a refresh token for refreshing the access token
		next time.

signin_code(request, code, redirect_uri)
	Signs in a user using the authorization code grant received
	from various identity providers (IdPs), including social networks
	(Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), enterprise systems (Microsoft
	Active Directory), and others.

	Upon parsing the response, it sets the auth session in the request and
	returns a User instance. Otherwise, an AuthEngineError instance with error
	information is returned; the request session is unchanged.

	request
		Django HttpRequest

	code
		authorization code grant provided by IdP

	redirect_uri
		the URL for which the code was intended.

signup(request, email, password, username = None,
	connection = cfg.Provider.USERNAME_PASSWORD_REALM, user_metadata = None,
	given_name = None, family_name = None, name = None, nickname = None,
	picture = None, keep_signed_in = False)

	Registers a user with Auth0 application using email address, password,
	and additional information.
		
	Upon successful registration, it sets the auth session in the request
	and returns a User instance. Otherwise, an AuthEngineError instance with
	error information is returned.

	request
		Django HttpRequest.

	email
		The user's email address.

	password
		The user's desired password.

	username
		The user's username, if required by the database connection.

	connection
		The name of the database connection where this user should be created.
		By default, it uses the "Username-Password-Authentication" connection.

	user_metadata
		Additional key-value information to store for the user. Some
		limitations apply, see:
		https://auth0.com/docs/metadata#metadata-restrictions

	given_name
		The user's given name(s).

	family_name
		The user's family name(s).

	name
		The user's full name.

	nickname
		The user's nickname.

	picture
		A URI pointing to the user's picture.

	keep_signed_in
		Whether or not to fetch a refresh token for refreshing the access token
		next time.

change_password(email, connection = cfg.Provider.USERNAME_PASSWORD_REALM,
	organization = None)
	
	Sends a password change email to the email address if a user with that
	email exists. 

	email
		email address of the user.

	connection
		The name of the database connection where the user was created. By
		default, it uses the "Username-Password-Authentication" connection.

refresh_access_token(request, refresh_token,
	scope = cfg.Provider.Scopes.DEFAULT)
	Refreshes an access token using the provided refresh_token.
	 
	Upon refreshment returns a User instance; an AuthEngineError instance with
	error information is returned otherwise. It sets the _token_refreshed flag
	in the response which is used by other functions to decide whether or not
	to update the request session.

	refresh_token
		the refresh token.

	scope
		Used to limit the scopes of the new access token. Multiple scopes are
		separated with whitespace. The default value is
		cfg.Provider.Scopes.DEFAULT.

authenticate(request)
	Authenticates a HttpRequest instance.

	The authentication session data is retrieved from the request session and
	passed to parse_response(). If parse_response() refreshes the tokens, the
	session data is updated in HttpRequest. It returns the same instance as the
	parse_response().
	
	request
		Django HttpRequest.

authenticate_header(request)
	Functions similarly to authenticate(), except that the tokens are parsed
	from the request header instead of the request session. Returns the return
	value of parse_response().

	request
		Django HttpRequest.

get_user(request, access_token)
	Exchanges an access_token for a User instance. Returns User if successful;
	AuthEngineError otherwise.

	request
		Django HttpRequest.
		
	access_token
		The access token.
