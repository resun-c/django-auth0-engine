class AuthEngineResponse(**kwarg):
	AuthEngineResponse serves as a base class for various response objects
	returned by different methods of this module. It provides a standardized
	way to access response data and check for successful operations.

	Args:
		**kwarg: keyword argument containing information of the  response.

	These are the property available in a AuthEngineResponse object:

	AuthEngineResponse.access_token
		Access token received from the operation (if available).

	AuthEngineResponse.refresh_token
		Refresh token received from the operation (if available).
		
	AuthEngineResponse.id_token
		ID token received from the operation (if available).

	AuthEngineResponse.token_type
		Type of the access token (if available).

	AuthEngineResponse.expires_in
		Expiration time of the access token (if available).

	AuthEngineResponse.message
		Message received from the Auth0 endpoint (if applicable).

	These are the methods available in a AuthEngineResponse object:
	
	AuthEngineResponse.__bool__()
		Returns the value of the private [1] variable _bool. Various subclasses
		determine the value of _bool based on the outcome of an operation. Upon
		successful operation, _bool must be set to True; otherwise, it remains
		False. By default, _bool is initialized as False.

	AuthEngineResponse.__str__()
		Returns a formatted string containing all the public [1] properties of the
		response object. The formatting utilizes the pprint.pformat() method.
	
	AuthEngineResponse.__repr__()
		Returns a formatted string containing all properties, including both
		public [1] and private [1] ones, of the response. The formatting utilizes the
		pprint.pformat() method.
	
	AuthEngineResponse.__iter__()
		This method returns an iterator object, enabling iteration through the
		public [1] variables of the response object.

	Inheritance:
	
		User: Represents a successful authentication and provides OIDC
			information of the authenticated user.

		AuthEngineError: Represents an error encountered during an operation
			and contains detailed information of the error.
	
	Example Usage:

	```
	response = auth_engine.signin(request, username="johndoe", password="secret")
	if response:
		user = response
		print(f"User ID: {user.id}")
	else:
		print(f"Error: {response.error}")

	```
