class ManagementEngine(domain, auth_engine)
	ManagementEngine facilitates administrative tasks on the Auth0 platform,
	specifically focusing on updating user information.

	ManagementEngine relies on the same pieces of information that AuthEngine
	relies on to. If any of these required pieces of information are missing,
	an error will be raised.

	Each AuthEngine object has these attributes:

	cached_property ManagementEngine._auth0
		An instance of the Auth0 class from the Auth0 SDK.

	cached_property ManagementEngine.token_endpoint
		Returns an instance of auth0.authentication.GetToken.

	property ManagementEngine.access_token
		Return a access token for the Management API. It automatically
		refreshes the token if expired and raises an AuthEngineError if the
		refresh fails.

	These are the methods available in a user object:

	ManagementEngine.fetch_management_token()
		Retrieves a Management API token using the token endpoint. Returns True
		upon success; False otherwise.

	ManagementEngine.update_user(id, body)
		Updates a user's information based on the provided id and body data. On
		successful update, returns an AuthEngineResponse object containing the
		updated information.

	The ManagementEngine class only serves one purpose: updating user
	information. The update_user method is typically called by the User class
	after changing a user's attributes.
