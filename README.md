# Django Auth0 Engine

Django Auth0 Engine is a simple Django Authentication Backend that utilizes
OAuth, OIDC, and Auth0 technology to perform authentication and
authorization securely. It focuses on empowering developers to build secure
and user-friendly applications with simplified authentication and resource
management.

## 1. Advantages:

- Secured authentication system employing OAuth, OIDC, and Auth0
	technology.

- Automatic user authentication through middleware; authenticated user
	readily available in `request.user` as `User` object.

- Comprehensive and flexible User object with directly accessible
	database records

- functionality for resource management implemented in the `User` object.

## 2. Getting Started:

1. Install and Configure the engine
   
2. Add middleware
   
3. Access `request.user` to perform the authentication process.

## 3. Setup

### 3.1 Installation

```
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
--no-deps django-auth0-engine
```

### 3.2 Configuration

1. Create an Auth0 application and set it up first.

2. Collect the `client_id` and `client_secret` of the application,
	tenant `domain` name and API `audience` (for only authentication
	purposes it is the `client_id`)

3. Add the `"django_auth0_engine"` app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in
	settings.

4. In settings define these attributes with `client_id`,
	`client_secret`, tenant `domain` and API `audience`:

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID		=	"client_id"

AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET	=	"client_secret"

AUTH0_DOMAIN		=	"tenant domain"

AUTH0_AUDIENCE		=	"API audience"
```

You can set the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` to `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` or ignore it
if you are not intending to use anything other than authentication.

### 3.3 Adding the middlewares

Django Auth0 Engine comes with two middleware to make the
authentication process easy and resource-effective.

#### 3.3.1. SessionAuthMiddleware

This middleware authenticates the requests made from the browser using
the ID tokens from the session.

To use it, add this to your `MIDDLEWARE` list:

```
'django_auth0_engine.middleware.SessionAuthMiddleware'
```

See the [SessionAuthMiddleware](docs/reference/md/middleware.md#class-sessionauthmiddleware) documentation for details.

#### 3.3.2. HeaderAuthMiddleware

To authenticate the requests of your API, use this middleware. It is
like `SessionAuthMiddleware`, but instead of using sessions, it uses
the `Bearer` token from the `Authorization` header for authentication.

To use it, add this to your `MIDDLEWARE` list:

```
'django_auth0_engine.middleware.HeaderAuthMiddleware'
```

See the [SessionAuthMiddleware](docs/reference/md/middleware.md#class-headerauthmiddleware) documentation for details.

You can use both of these middleware in the same project, and they're
compatible with Django's built-in authentication middleware.

### 3.4 Setting User Database Backend

To integrate a database for users, assign a custom database backend
class to the `USER_DB_BACKEND` attribute in settings. Then you can
access the user's database record through the `User.db` property
directly from your code.

```
USER_DB_BACKEND = UserDB			# UserDB is a class with database
									# control
```

See the [User Database Backend](#user-database) section bellow for more details.

## 4. Usage

Django Auth0 Engine provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing
user authentication, authorization, and resource management within your
Django application. The `AuthEngine` class facilitates user
authentication and user registration. The `ManagementEngine` aims at
resource management.

### 4.1. Signing up:

The `AuthEngine.signup()` method helps you register users with Auth0
application. To use it, simply provide a Django HttpRequest object, the
user's email address, password, and any other information needed by
your specific Auth0 setup (see the [AuthEngine.signup()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesignuprequest-email-password-connection-username-user_metadata-given_name-family_name-name-nickname-picture-signin-keep_signed_in)
documentation for more details).

Upon successful sign up, it sets the session cookie in the request
object and returns a `User` object. Otherwise, an `AuthEngineError` object
with error information is returned; the request session is unchanged. A
verification mail is also sent to the email address.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signup_user(request):
	username = request.POST["username"]
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signup(
		request = request,
		email = email,
		password = password,
		username = username
	)

	if user:
		# successful user creation
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful user creation
		...
```

It has other functionality for finer control over the sign up process.
See the [AuthEngine.signup()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesignuprequest-email-password-connection-username-user_metadata-given_name-family_name-name-nickname-picture-signin-keep_signed_in) documentation for details.

### 4.2. Sign up/Sign in with provider

The `AuthEngine.signin_code()` method allows sign-in using various
identity providers (IdPs), including social networks (Google, Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn), enterprise systems (Microsoft Active Directory),
and others.

This method takes a Django `HttpRequest` object and the grant code
received from the selected IdP as argument.

Upon authentication, it sets the session cookie in the request object
and returns a `User` object. Otherwise, an `AuthEngineError` object with
error information is returned; the request session is unchanged.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def callback(request):
	code = request.GET["code"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin_code(request, code)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

### 4.3. Signing in:

The sign in process is done by the `AuthEngine.signin()` method. This
method takes a Django `HttpRequest` object, the user's email address as
username, password, and any additional information required by Auth0
(see the [AuthEngine.signin()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesigninrequest-username-password-scope-realm-audience-grant_type-forwarded_for-keep_signed_in) documentation for details)..

Upon successful sign in, it sets the session cookie in the request
object and returns a `User` object. Otherwise, an `AuthEngineError` object
with error information is returned; the request session is unchanged.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signin_user(request):
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin(
		request,
		username = email,
		password = password,
	)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

To prolonged user sessions without requiring manual intervention you
can set the `keep_signed_in` parameter to True. It fetches a refresh
token. So when the user session expires, other methods of `AuthEngine`
automatically exchange the refresh token with a new ID token to keep
the user signed in.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signin_user(request):
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin(
		request,
		username = email,
		password = password,
		keep_signed_in = True,
	)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

### 4.4. Authenticate request:

If you have added the `SessionAuthMiddleware` the user authentication
happens automatically. Access the authenticated user directly through
the `request.user` property in your Django views.

Example:

```
def home(request):
	user = request.user
	if user:
		# successfully authentication
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful authentication
		...
```

However, manual authentication can be done by the
`AuthEngine.authenticate()` method. This method authenticates a Django
`HttpRequest` object and upon successful authentication, it returns a
`User` object; `AuthEngineError` otherwise. See the
[AuthEngine.authenticate()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authengineauthenticaterequest) documentation for details.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def aview(request):
	user = AuthEngine().authenticate(request)

if user:
	# successful authentication
	...
else:
	# unsuccessful authentication
	...
```

## 5. User object

The `User` object is a crucial element of this module and plays a
critical role in user management within your application. It' just like
the standard Django `User` object but it has capabilities to leveraging
OIDC and Auth0 technologies.

### 5.1 User Database Backend

The `User` object in Django Auth0 Engine is constructed using OpenID
Connect (OIDC) information for a lightweight representation of the
user. It doesn't have database interaction by default. However, it
provides functionalities for integrating your chosen database backend.

To enable database interaction, configure `USER_DB_BACKEND` with your
User Database Backend. Then you can access the user's database record
through the `User.db` property in your code.

See the [Writing User Database Backend](docs/md/user_object.md#writing-user-database-backend) documentation for details on making a User Database Backend.

Here's an example:

in `settings.py`

```
USER_DB_BACKEND = UserFirestore		# see the Writing User Database
									# Backend section bellow
```

in `views.py`

```
def home(request):
	user = request.user
	if user:
		user_record = user.db		# user_record is an instance of
									# UserFirestore that represents the
									# document of the user in Firestore
		...
	else:
		# unauthorized
		...
```

`User` object has other functionality including multiple database
backends. See the [User](docs/md/user_object.md) documentation for details.
