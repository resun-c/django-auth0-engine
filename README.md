# Django Auth0 Engine
Django Auth0 Engine is a simple Django Authentication Backend that utilizes OAuth, OIDC, and Auth0 technology to perform authentication and authorization securely. It focuses on empowering developers to build secure and user-friendly applications with simplified authentication and resource management.

# Install

```
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps django-auth0-engine
```

# Setup

## Configuration

1. Create an Auth0 application and set it up first.

2. Collect the `client_id` and `client_secret` of the application, tenant `domain` name and API `audience` (for only authentication purposes it is the client_id)

3. Add the `"django_auth0_engine"` app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in settings.

4. In settings define these attributes with `client_id`, `client_secret`, tenant `domain` and API `audience`:

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID		=	"client_id"

AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET	=	"client_secret"

AUTH0_DOMAIN		=	"tenant domain"

AUTH0_AUDIENCE		=	"API audience"
```

You can set the `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` to `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` or ignore it if you are not intending to use anything other than authentication.

## Adding the middlewares

Django Auth0 Engine comes with two middleware to make the authentication process easy and resource-effective.

### SessionAuthMiddleware

This middleware authenticates each request using the `AuthEngine.authenticate()` method which in turn sets the `request.user` with a `User` object with OIDC information of the authenticated user.

To use this middleware, add this string to the `MIDDLEWARE` list:

```
'django_auth0_engine.middleware.SessionAuthMiddleware'
```

#### Example:

Here's an example of authenticating a request using this middleware after an user has been successfully signed in using the `AuthEngine.signin()` method:

```
def home(request: HttpRequest):
	user = request.user
	if user:
		# successful authentication
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful authentication
		...
```

### HeaderAuthMiddleware

The `HeaderAuthMiddleware` is similar to the `SessionAuthMiddleware` except that it authenticates the header and is used for APIs.

To use it add this to your `MIDDLEWARE` list:
```
'django_auth0_engine.middleware.HeaderAuthMiddleware'
```

Example:

If a request is made to your API by setting the `Authorization` header with `Bearer` token like this:

```
curl --request GET \
	--url http://your-domain.com/api_path \
	--header 'authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

This middleware will perform authentication using the `AuthEngine.authenticate_header()` method which verifies the `ACCESS_TOKEN` and set the `request.user` with a `User` object with OIDC information of the authenticated user.

Both of these middleware can co-exist in a project. Further, they both can be used along with Django's existing authentication system.

## Setting User Database Backend
This module provides a flexible way to integrate your chosen database with user management through the `User.db` property. By defining a dedicated database backend class, you can access the user's associated database entry directly from your code.

In your settings, assign the `USER_DB_BACKEND` attribute the name of your database backend class. This informs the `User` object which class to use for database interaction.

```
USER_DB_BACKEND = UserDB			# UserDB is a class with database control
```

See the [User Database](#user-database) section for more details.

# Usage

Django Auth0 Engine provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing user authentication, authorization, and resources within your Django application. The `AuthEngine` class facilitates with user authentication and user registration. The `ManagementEngine` aims on resource management.

## Authentication

### 1. Signing up:

User signup is facilitated by the `AuthEngine.signup()` method. This method takes a Django `HttpRequest` object, along with the user's email address, password, and any optional additional information required by your Auth0 configuration (see the [AuthEngine.signup()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesignuprequest-email-password-connection-username-user_metadata-given_name-family_name-name-nickname-picture-signin-keep_signed_in) documentation for details). Upon successful signup:

- An `AuthEngineResponse` object is returned, containing a message and confirmation information.

- A verification email is automatically sent to the provided email address.

- The user remains unauthenticated at this stage and needs to log in after verifying their email.

- Optionally, you can enable automatic signin after signup by setting the `signin` argument to `True`. This will automatically authenticate the user after successful signup and create session cookies for subsequent requests and set the `request.user` with a `User` object.

Here's a breakdown of the signup process:

1. Call `AuthEngine.signup()` with user details.

2. Upon success, receive an `AuthEngineResponse` and a verification email.

3. Verify the user's email address.

4. Either:

	- Sign in manually using AuthEngine.signin() method.

	- (Optional) Sign in automatically by setting `signin` argument to `True`.

Note: Verification is crucial for ensuring user security and preventing unauthorized account creation.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signup_user(request):
	username = request.POST["username"]
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signup(
		request = request,
		email = email,
		password = password,
		username = username
	)

	if user:
		# user successfully created
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to created user
		...

```

Sign in automatically:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signup_user(request):
	username = request.POST["username"]
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signup(
		request = request,
		email = email,
		password = password,
		username = username,
		signin = True
	)

	if user:
		# user successfully created
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to created user
		...

```

It has other functionality for finer control over signup process. See the [AuthEngine.signup()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesignuprequest-email-password-connection-username-user_metadata-given_name-family_name-name-nickname-picture-signin-keep_signed_in) documentation for details.

### 2. Signup/Signin with provider

The `AuthEngine.signin_code()` method allows sign in using various identity providers (IdPs), including social networks (Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), enterprise systems (Microsoft Active Directory), and others.

This method takes a Django `HttpRequest` object and the grant code received from the selected IdP as arguments.

Upon authentication, it sets session in the request object and return a `User` object. Otherwise, an `AuthEngineError` object with error information is returned, request session is unchanged.

Example

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def callback(request):
	code = request.GET["code"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin_code(request, code)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

### 3. Signing in:
The signing in process is performed by the `AuthEngine.signin()` method. This method takes a Django `HttpRequest` object, along with the user's email address as username, password, and any additional information required by Auth0 (see the [AuthEngine.signin()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authenginesigninrequest-username-password-scope-realm-audience-grant_type-forwarded_for-keep_signed_in) documentation for details).

Upon authentication, it sets session in the request object and return a `User` object. Otherwise, an `AuthEngineError` object with error information is returned, request session is unchanged.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signin_user(request):
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin(
		request,
		username = email,
		password = password,
	)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

To prolonged user sessions without requiring manual intervention you can set the `keep_signed_in` parameter to True. It fetches a refresh token. So when the user session expires, other method of `AuthEngine` automatically exchange the refresh token with a new id token to keep the user signed in.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def signin_user(request):
	email = request.POST["email"]
	password = request.POST["password"]

	user = AuthEngine().signin(
		request,
		username = email,
		password = password,
	keep_signed_in = True,
	)
	if user:
		# successfully signed in
	    ...
	else:
		# unsuccessful to sign in
	    ...
```

### 4. Authenticate request:
If you have added the `SessionAuthMiddleware` the user authentication happens automatically. Access the authenticated user directly through the `request.user` attribute in your Django views.

However, manual authentication can be performed by the `AuthEngine.authenticate()` method. This method authenticates a Django `HttpRequest` object and upon successful authentication, it returns a `User` object; `AuthEngineError` otherwise. See the [AuthEngine.authenticate()](docs/reference/md/auth_engine.md#authengineauthenticaterequest) documentation for details.

Example:

```
from django_auth0_engine import AuthEngine

def aview(request):
	user = AuthEngine().authenticate(request)

	if user:
		# successful authentication
		...
	else:
		# unsuccessful authentication
		...
```

## User object
The User object is a fundamental element of the Django Auth0 Engine and plays a critical role in user management within your application. It resembles the standard Django User object but extends its capabilities by specifically leveraging OIDC and Auth0 technologies.

### User Database
The `User` object in Django Auth0 Engine is built using OpenID Connect (OIDC) information obtained from Auth0 ID tokens. This allows for a lightweight representation of the user without requiring database interaction by default. However, the `User` object provides functionalities for seamlessly integrating with your chosen database backend.

To utilize database interaction, configure `USER_DB_BACKEND` with your a method or class. Access the user's database entry through the `User.db` property in your code.

Backend configuration:

- Method: Set `USER_DB_BACKEND` to a function that receives user's OIDC attributes as key word arguments and returns the database entry.

- Class: Set `USER_DB_BACKEND` to a class that can be initialized with the user's OIDC attributes and provides methods for accessing and manipulating the user's database representation.

Here's an example:

```
def home(request):
	user = request.user
	if user:
		user_db = user.db
		...
	else:
		# unauthorized
		...
```

See the [examples / user_db_backends.md](docs/examples/user_db_backends.md) documentation for details.

User object has other functionality including multiple database backend. See the [User](docs/reference/md/user.md#class-userkwarg) documentation for details.
