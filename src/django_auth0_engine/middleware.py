	This middleware assigns the returned object to the request.user attribute.

	The AuthEngine.authenticate() method is wrapped into a lambda function and
	passed to SimpleLazyObject, and then the SimpleLazyObject is assigned to
	the request.user attribute. This mechanism allows the authenticate() method
	to only get invoked when the user property of the request is accessed. This
	saves both resources and time.
